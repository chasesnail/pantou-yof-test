Description:  This package contains the OPENFLOW userspace implementation.
 OpenFlow is an architecture for Ethernet switches and 
 routers, which allows a researcher to experiment 
 with new functionality in their own network; for example, 
 to add a new routing protocol, a new management technique, a 
 novel packet processing algorithm, or even - eventually - 
 alternatives to IP.
